# QuantumLeap: Quantized Forex Binary Option Price Prediction with LSTM Networks

This repository houses QuantumLeap, a Go-based project focused on predicting the price movements of Forex currency pairs for binary option trading using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It leverages quantized data to reduce memory footprint and computational overhead, and implements stochastic oscillator-based feature engineering to enhance predictive accuracy. The project also provides a backtesting framework to evaluate the performance of trained models under various market conditions.

QuantumLeap aims to provide a robust and efficient platform for developing and deploying automated trading strategies for Forex binary options. By employing LSTM networks, the project capitalizes on their ability to learn long-term dependencies in time series data, making them well-suited for analyzing Forex price movements. The quantization of price data allows for efficient storage and processing, crucial for real-time applications. Furthermore, the integration of stochastic oscillators provides valuable insight into overbought and oversold conditions, improving the model's ability to anticipate price reversals. The built-in backtesting framework allows users to rigorously evaluate their strategies before deploying them in live trading environments.

The key benefit of QuantumLeap lies in its ability to provide a customizable and scalable solution for Forex binary option price prediction. The modular architecture allows developers to easily integrate new features, such as different technical indicators or alternative machine learning models. The use of Go ensures efficient execution and concurrency, enabling the project to handle large volumes of data and complex computations. The project is designed to be accessible to both experienced machine learning practitioners and novice developers interested in exploring the application of deep learning to financial markets. The comprehensive documentation and examples provided in this README will guide users through the installation, configuration, and usage of the project.

## Key Features

*   **LSTM Network Architecture:** Implements a configurable LSTM network architecture for time series prediction. Users can adjust the number of layers, hidden units, and other hyperparameters to optimize performance for specific currency pairs and timeframes. The LSTM network is implemented using the Gonum numerical computing library.
*   **Quantized Data Representation:** Utilizes data quantization techniques to reduce memory usage and computational cost. Price data is quantized into discrete levels, allowing for efficient storage and processing. The quantization level is configurable and impacts both memory usage and prediction accuracy.
*   **Stochastic Oscillator Feature Engineering:** Integrates stochastic oscillator calculations as input features to the LSTM network. The stochastic oscillator provides information on the relative position of the current price within a given price range, indicating potential overbought or oversold conditions. The calculation uses a configurable lookback period.
*   **Backtesting Framework:** Provides a comprehensive backtesting framework for evaluating the performance of trained models. The framework allows users to simulate trading strategies using historical data and assess their profitability and risk. Users can configure the backtesting parameters, such as the initial capital, position size, and trading rules.
*   **Real-time Data Integration:** Designed for integration with real-time Forex data feeds. The project can be configured to receive data from various sources, such as REST APIs or streaming services. The data is preprocessed and fed into the LSTM network for price prediction.
*   **Modular Design:** Implements a modular architecture that allows for easy extension and customization. Developers can easily add new features, such as different technical indicators or alternative machine learning models. The code is organized into well-defined packages, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Written in Go, ensuring cross-platform compatibility. The project can be compiled and executed on various operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Technology Stack

*   **Go:** The primary programming language used for development, chosen for its efficiency, concurrency features, and cross-platform compatibility.
*   **Gonum:** A set of numerical libraries for Go, used for matrix operations, linear algebra, and other mathematical computations required for the LSTM network implementation.
*   **Gorgonia:** A library that facilitates machine learning in Go. Used for defining and training the LSTM network.
*   **Go Modules:** Go's dependency management system, used to manage project dependencies and ensure reproducibility.
*   **(Optional) PostgreSQL:** Used for storing historical Forex data and backtesting results (can be replaced with other databases).

## Installation

1.  Ensure you have Go installed (version 1.16 or higher) and configured correctly. Verify this by running `go version` in your terminal.
2.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ezozu/QuantumLeap.git`
3.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd QuantumLeap`
4.  Download dependencies using Go modules: `go mod download`
5.  Build the project: `go build -o quantumleap`

## Configuration

The project utilizes environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and define the following variables:

*   `FOREX_API_KEY`: Your API key for accessing Forex data. (If using a third party API)
*   `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string for your PostgreSQL database (if using PostgreSQL for data storage). Example: `postgres://user:password@host:port/database`
*   `QUANTIZATION_LEVELS`: The number of quantization levels to use for price data (e.g., 100).
*   `LSTM_HIDDEN_UNITS`: The number of hidden units in the LSTM network (e.g., 64).
*   `STOCHASTIC_OSCILLATOR_LOOKBACK`: The lookback period for the stochastic oscillator calculation (e.g., 14).
*   `TRADING_PAIR`: The Forex currency pair to trade (e.g., EURUSD).

Example `.env` file:

FOREX_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/quantumleapdb
QUANTIZATION_LEVELS=100
LSTM_HIDDEN_UNITS=64
STOCHASTIC_OSCILLATOR_LOOKBACK=14
TRADING_PAIR=EURUSD

## Usage

Before running the application, make sure to train your model using a sufficient amount of historical data. The training process involves fetching historical data, preprocessing it, constructing the LSTM network, and training it using an optimization algorithm. The trained model can be saved to a file and loaded for real-time predictions.

Example code snippet for loading the trained model:

// loadModel loads the trained model from a file.
/*
func loadModel(filename string) (*gorgonia.ExprGraph, error) {
	f, err := os.Open(filename)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	defer f.Close()

	g := gorgonia.NewGraph()
	if err := gorgonia.ReadExprGraph(f, g); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	return g, nil
}
*/

To run the application: `./quantumleap`

The application will start fetching real-time Forex data, preprocess it, and feed it into the LSTM network for price prediction. The predicted price movements can then be used to generate trading signals for binary options. The backtesting framework can be used to evaluate the performance of the trading strategy.
